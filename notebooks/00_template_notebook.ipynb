    "Notice that the white land-masked regions are distorted away from the coastlines in the Arctic in the above plot. This is because a tripolar grid is used, so the grid lines are not zonal and meridional north of 65N, and consequently the nominal 1D coordinates `xh` and `yh` are incorrect. To fix this we need to use 2d coordinates `geolon` and `geolat`.\n",
