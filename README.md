# access-om3-paper-1

A collaborative project to create and discuss figures for a description and assessment paper for [ACCESS-OM3-25km](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs).

All community members (and ACCESS-NRI staff) can get write write access to this repository. To get write access, you need to create an issue and request access.

The paper is being written [here on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pygvjbmmghsv#b18c9c). Please ask if you'd like edit access.

## How it works

All aspects of the project are tracked through [issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-25km-paper-1/issues). Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the main branch (or merge directly).

TODO: As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the [Results_summary.md](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-25km-paper-1/blob/main/Results_summary.md) and [Figure_outline.md](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-25km-paper-1/blob/main/Figure_outline.md).

## Notebooks

Notebooks should be grouped in topic-related subfolders in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-25km-paper-1/blob/main/notebooks).

TODO: provide a template notebook - e.g. see [here](https://github.com/pedrocol/basal_mom5-collaborative-project/blob/main/notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb)

TODO: define common parameters - e.g. see [here](https://github.com/pedrocol/basal_mom5-collaborative-project?tab=readme-ov-file#plotting-formatsdict)
- experiment runs to use, and terminology for them
- line styles
- climatology start/end dates
